# SPL-Techincal-Assessment

## Introduction :

**Assessment branch contains the problems that you need to solve and all 
the problems are converted to basic, adavanced and OOP. Each folder has
a separate Readme.md file. Basic and Advanced problems are mostly functional.
Solve them in the order you prefer.**

## Basic Assessment:

### Arrays

1. Array Left Rotation
2. Array Reversal

### Dictionaries And Hashmaps

1. Shared SubStrings between Two Strings
2. Comparison of Two dictionaries/maps for equality

### Sorting

1. Distribute a set of Numbers around given pivot.
_(Make a good choice for sorting algorithm)_
2. Find maximum number from a list of numbers (both negative and non-negative).
_(Make a good choice for sorting algorithm)_

### String Manipulation & Trees

1. Compare the strands of two genomes report similarity index in percentages.
2. Remove a character from the entire string.

## Advanced

### Greedy Algorithms

1. Minimum absolute difference in an array.

### Search

1. Given an array of integers and a target value, determine the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to the target value.
2. Find the frequency of numbers in a array.

### Dynamic Programming

1. Solve Fibonacci problem using memoization.
2. Find Longest Common SubSequence in two strings.

### Recursion And Backtracking

1. Calculate Mean of An Array using recursion.

## Object Oriented Programming
