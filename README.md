## Brief:

#### In the field of Computer Science, we have different programmaing paradigms, patterns 
    and approachesto problem solving. 

##### Imperative Programming:
        
        Imperative Programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that 
        change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in 
        natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of 
        commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on 
        describing how a program operates.

        e.g. Object Oriented Programming, Procedural Calls, Polymorphic Algorithms etc.
    
##### Declarative Programming:

        a. In Computer Science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm, 
        a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that 
        expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

        e.g. Functional Programming, Inductive Logic, Concurrent Logic etc..
