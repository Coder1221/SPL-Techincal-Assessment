# SPL-Techincal-Assessment

## Introduction :

    This repository is designed and created to test the basic, advanced and challenging 
    technical skills for the new recruits. 
    Remains the intellectual property of System Plus Pvt. Limited.

## Brief:

#### In the field of Computer Science, we have different programmaing paradigms, patterns and approaches to problem solving. You will be majorly tested on these listed programming paradigms.

##### Imperative Programming:
        
        Imperative Programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that 
        change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in 
        natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of 
        commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on 
        describing how a program operates.

        e.g. Object Oriented Programming, Procedural Calls, Polymorphic Algorithms etc.
    
##### Declarative Programming:

        In Computer Science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm, 
        a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that 
        expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

        e.g. Functional Programming, Inductive Logic, Concurrent Logic etc..

## Instructions:

        1. This repository has a branch name Assessment. Clone this repository 
        and checkout to Assessment branch.

        2. You are not allowed to push code to this repository. Therefore you are 
        required to create a copy of this repository on your own account and work on it. 
        Hint: Make good use of git clone, git fork, git plugins for vs code etc.

        3. In Assessment branch there will be tasks in folders. Each task folder will have
        a descriptive name and will have Readme.md file, please read the instructions carefully 
        and implement solutions.

        4. A programming language of desired choice can be used to implement solution 
        keeping the paradigms in mind i.e. Object Oriented Solutions are not implementable 
        in Functional Programming Languages. 

        5. After you are done implementing a task, please add comments in the code file 
        for clear understanding and edit Readme.md file at the end of it with a heading 
        "Run Instructions" and write the command required to run your file to test it.

        6. This will be an open ended programming exercise. Problem descriptions are 
        provided and you are free to choose the programming language, although you will have 
        to follow the paradigm instructed to solve that problem. You are allowed to write 
        your own test cases where required to elaborate your approach.

        7. In case of confusions, please contact us at our email.
