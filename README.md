# SPL-Techincal-Assessment

## Introduction :

    Assessment branch contains the problems that you need to solve and all
    the problems are converted to basic, adavanced and OOP. Each folder has 
    a separate Readme.md file. Basic and Advanced problems are mostly functional.
    Solve them in the order you prefer.

## Basic Assessment:

### Arrays

    a. Array Left Rotation

    b. Array Reversal

### Dictionaries And Hashmaps

    a. Shared SubStrings between Two Strings 

    b. Comparison of Two dictionaries/maps for equality

### Sorting

    a. Distribute a set of Numbers around given pivot. 
    (Make a good choice for sorting algorithm)

    b. Find maximum number from a list of numbers (both negative and non-negative).
     (Make a good choice for sorting algorithm)

### String Manipulation & Trees

    a. Compare the strands of two genomes report similarity index in percentages.

    b. Remove a character from the entire string.


## Advanced

### Greedy Algorithms

    a. Minimum absolute difference in an array.

### Search 

    a. Given an array of integers and a target value, determine the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to the target value.

    b. Find the frequency of numbers in a array.

### Dynamic Programming

    a. Solve Fibonacci problem using memoization.

    b. Find Longest Common SubSequence in two strings.

### Recursion And Backtracking

    a. Calculate Mean of An Array using recursion.
